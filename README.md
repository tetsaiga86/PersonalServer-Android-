# PersonalServer-Android Client
## Introduction:
This is an Android client app that connects to an express server running on a windows computer over https. This client is meant to be paired with the windows server that can be found here: https://github.com/tetsaiga86/PersonalServerDeployment-Windows-

## Directions For Setup:

- Transfer the apk file to your android device and install (Note: Only Android version 4.0.3 and higher is supported at this time) 
- Start the windows server
- Start Personal Server app
- Click Scan QR Code
 * If the app does not find a suitable QR scanner it will prompt the user to download it
 * After installing the QR app return to Personal Server app 
- Click QR Code

- When running the same instance of the server, clicking Login will used the saved QR information to access the server

If all is working correctly, you should see a listing of your server root directory.
